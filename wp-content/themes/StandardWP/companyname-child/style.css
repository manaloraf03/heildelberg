Description: A Custom Wordpress Theme for Company Name
Version: 1.0

/*
NOTES:
======

(1.) You can't put your styles in this file (style.css). Put them in css/companyname-child.css

(3.) Since downloads of Company Name from GitHub will be in a folder named 'companyname', therefore in the CSS comment header above I have put 'Template: companyname'. If the Company Name root folder has a different name, then you must make the SAME change to the Template line in the CSS comment above.

(3.) You can make this child theme your own by simply:

(a.) Change the name of the root folder
(b.) Change the name of the stylesheet css/companyname-child.css
(c.) In functions.php, do a search-and-replace for these two terms:

        "companyname-child" => "yourtheme-name"
        "companyname_child" => "yourtheme_name"

(d.) Change the Theme Name in the CSS comment in this file (style.css)
